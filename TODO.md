# Anxiety Garden — To-Do

_Last updated 2026-06-15._

## 🔴 Needs Lisa (decisions / clinical / design)
- [ ] **Redline the `SIGNATURE` map** in `sundial.html` — which body qualities point to which feeling (e.g. fear = fluttery/cold/tight, anger = hot/tight). The body-first narrow's accuracy rides on this. Also the `REGIONS` / `QUALITIES` wording.
- [ ] **Flat 6-disc art** — draw a faceted, top-down 6-segment disc that matches the tilted one (same palette + white dividers), so turning the dial keeps the craft. (Or: I warm up the code wheel as a stopgap.)
- [ ] **Body figure** in the drill-down — keep & soften, swap for a calmer outline, or drop and use words.
- [ ] **Confirm the 6 weather colours** — anger red · joy amber · disgust green · sadness blue · fear purple · surprise pink.
- [ ] **Sensation→garden-place map** (§6) — for the cast's place-glows (currently placeholder in the garden's `CAST` config).
- [ ] **Redeploy in Coolify** to see the latest (alarm fix, 6-wheel, body-first walk). Push doesn't auto-deploy.

## 🟡 Finish the guided walk (sundial)
- [ ] **Coarse step** — pleasant/unpleasant × calm/charged, between *notice* and *narrow* (easiest rung for severe alexithymia; `valence` is already seeded in the data).
- [ ] **Tell-apart beat** — promote the granular pair (anxiety vs excitement) to its own step after the pick, not buried in the drill-down.
- [ ] **Express beat** — "what's it asking for / how would you say it"; needs one `ask` line per feeling.

## 🎨 First-person redraw (gardener = you, hands not avatar)
- [ ] Take the **third-person gardener figure out of the scene** (you're first-person now).
- [ ] Draw **first-person hands** for the tending verbs (plant / pull / water / turn the dial), ideally a recolourable skin-tone layer.
- [ ] Rework "the gardener gets locked out" as a **felt, first-person** beat (you can't act) rather than a figure stepping back.
- [ ] Open scope: full **first-person POV throughout**, or **hands for actions** + keep the wide "meet your garden" as a third-person establishing shot (no fixed gardener)?

## 🟢 Seeking & Care homes (off the wheel)
- [ ] **Seeking = the sun** — the always-there light/drive that casts the shadow (present in the whole instrument, not a slice).
- [ ] **Care = the nurturing pour + a between-gardens beat** — the watering can as nurture; relational warmth across the fence.

## 🔗 Intensity handshake (dial → garden)
- [ ] **Dial: send `detail.intensity` (0–1)** on `sundial:select`. The garden's `cast()` already reads it (defaults 0.5), so until the dial sends it, every weather renders mid-intensity. Source it from the dial's **radius** (mild→intense, MODEL §2) and/or the coarse read. Then worry-mist vs panic-fog actually differ in the garden.

## 🔵 Garden / integration polish
- [ ] **Rain reads as "fireworks"** — streaks too thick/bright/sparse + comet-gradient. Make it a continuous fall (thinner, more, lower opacity, full-height) or swap to the even repeating-gradient technique from `intensity-demo.html`.
- [ ] **Sweep all garden-scene weathers for contrast** (fog, storm, sun, the new yellow haze for disgust) — make each read clearly over the bright scene, same pass as rain.
- [ ] Optional: weather cast *behind the dial on screen 6* too (currently casts on the screen-1 scene).
- [ ] Minor: `bear-at-treeline.svg` is missing (the bear falls back to `bear-trim.png`) — pre-existing.

## ✅ Done (recent)
- 6-segment weather wheel (Seeking & Care taken off)
- Alarm fixed — `anxiety-garden.png` (storm image, SVG-only ref) had been gitignored → restored
- Body-first walk keystone: *notice → narrow* (the interoception → feeling translation)
- Cosmetic: removed the stray "0" rim markers + the blue rectangular focus box
- Sundial embedded in garden screen 6 as "today's weather" + verified cast bridge
- Docker deploy on Coolify; lean repo (394 MB → 21 MB)
